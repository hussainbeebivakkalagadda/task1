<h3 id="dog-name">Dogname</h3>
<p align="justify">The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.

The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.

<p align="justify">The Golden Retriever was developed in Scotland in the nineteenth century by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks (later to become Baron Tweedmouth) from Flat-coated Retrievers judiciously crossed with Tweed Water Spaniels and some other British dog breeds.[1][2] Prior to the 1952 publication of the very detailed stud book which had been meticulously maintained by Marjoribanks, a number of romantic tales were published about the origins of the breed.[1][2][3]

In the 1860s Marjoribanks set out to create what to his mind was the ultimate breed of retriever at his Scottish estate Guisachan.[1][4] He started by acquiring a yellow-coloured Flat-coated Retriever dog called Nous;[note 1] Nous had been whelped in June 1864 and was the only yellow pup in an otherwise all black-coloured litter.[1][3] Whilst uncommon, occasionally liver, brown, golden or yellow-coloured purebred Flat-coated Retriever pups are whelped to matings of two black parents.[2][5] It is the pedigree of Nous that was the source for the romantic tales of the heritage of the Golden Retriever.[1] One early account claimed Nous was purchased from a Russian circus trainer in Brighton, another claimed he was bought from a cobbler, and yet another claimed a gypsy.[1] The stud book states that Nous was a Flat-coated Retriever bred by Lord Chichester on his Stanmer Park estate near Brighton.[4][5][6]

In 1868 Nous was mated to a Tweed Water Spaniel bitch named Belle, who is recorded in the stud book as being whelped in 1863 and being of "Ladykirk breeding".[1][5] The litter from this mating consisted of four yellow pups, Primrose, Ada, Cowslip and Crocus.[6][7] The best bitch from this litter, Cowslip, was mated to a Tweed Water Spaniel called Tweed with the mating producing a bitch pup called Topsy.[4] Cowslip was subsequently mated to a Red Setter called Sampson; that mating produced a dog pup called Jack.[4] Topsy was mated with a black Flat-coated Retriever called Sambo and a bitch pup from that litter, Zoe, was mated back to Jack and two pups from that mating were retained, a dog called Nous II and a bitch called Gill.[4] Gill was mated to a black Labrador Retriever called Tracer, and a bitch pup from that mating, Queenie, was mated back to Nous II; all Golden Retrievers descend from this mating.[4] The progeny from these various matings varied in colour from pure black to light cream, but it was the golden-coloured ones that were retained and mated to each other, forming the foundation stock of the Golden Retriever breed.[1] Marjoribanks is also known to have used a sandy-coloured Bloodhound and another Labrador in subsequent years of the breeding programme</p>

<p align="justify">Golden Retrievers are a generally healthy breed; they have an average lifespan of 12 to 13 years.[9] Irresponsible breeding to meet high demand has led to the prevalence of inherited health problems in some breed lines, including allergic skin conditions, eye problems and sometimes snappiness.[9] These problems are rarely encountered in dogs bred from responsible breeders.[9]

The breed is unusually prone to cancer, with one United States study finding cancer to be the cause of death in approximately 50% of the population, the second highest in the study. Several European studies found a much lower prevalence (20–39%), which may reflect the significant genetic divergence between the American and European populations. They are especially prone to hemangiosarcoma and lymphoma, with an estimated lifetime risk of one in five for the former and one in eight for the latter. The high prevalence of cancer deaths among Golden Retrievers may partly represent a lack of other congenital diseases.[18][19][20]</p>

<p align="justify">The Golden Retriever is one of the most commonly kept breeds of companion dog in the Western world, and is often among the top ten dog breeds by number of registrations in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada.[1][2][14][15][16][17] It is a frequent competitor at dog shows; separate show lines of the breed have been developed.[2][7][11] The dogs can be trained as guide dogs and therapy dogs,[2][3] and may compete in obedience trials and other dog sports.[2][3]

The Golden Retriever is still used as a gundog by sportsmen, both as a hunting companion in the field and for competing in field trials.[2][7][11] It is used more for retrieval of land-based gamebirds such as grouse and partridge than for wildfowl hunting.[7] Those used as gundogs are usually from working lines specifically bred for field use; dogs from pet or show lines are rarely suitable.[2][7][11] A Golden Retriever with a traditional dense double coat is well suited to working in cold and wet conditions, as the coat provides water resistance and insulation.[7][11] Compared to other retriever breeds, the Golden Retriever is not a strong swimmer; its long coat causes it to sit low in the water when swimming.[7]

The Golden Retriever is much less commonly used by sportsmen as a hunting companion than the Labrador Retriever.[7][11] One reason is that the breed is generally quite slow to mature, particularly compared to the Labrador; often when a Golden Retriever is still in basic training a Labrador of the same age has already completed a season of hunting.[7][11] Another is its long coat, which requires more maintenance and grooming than that of the Labrador, particularly after working in muddy conditions or close cover, as their long hair is more prone to picking up dirt and burrs.[7][11] More Golden Retrievers are bred as pets or for the show ring than for hunting, so it can be hard for sportsmen to find pups bred from proven working lines.[11]

<p align="justify">There are few dog breeds as friendly and affectionate as the Golden Retriever. It’s why they’re one of the most popular family dogs. Goldens are a great balance between obedience and playfulness. Plus, they’re always well-mannered and get along great with kids.

So if you’re planning on raising a Golden Retriever, then you’ve already made a great decision. However, did you know that not all Golden Retrievers are the same color? Despite their name “golden,” these dogs actually come in 5 various shades of “gold.”

Each color is beautiful and unique in its own right. And while they may look all the same to the untrained eye, we’re here to break down the differences in colors. So if you’re planning on bringing one home, you will have a few options!
